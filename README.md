# pollux-AMR
An autonomous countertop-cleaning robot with integrated reinforcement learning to prevent falling off cliffs and hitting obstacles.

Stack Architecture:
- Python for coding & development
- Stable Baslines3 (built on PyTorch) or RLib for the RL library
- Gazebo or OpenAI Gymnasium for simulation
- ROS (Robot Operating System) for facilitating communication between the sensors/hardware, the RL libraries, and the simulation tools.
